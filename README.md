# Project Motivation
This Project was created as part of the Udacity DataScientist Nanodegree. It follows the CRISP-DM Process and should answer 3 specific Questions to Airbnb Open Dataset. For Crisp-DM Process see i.e. [here](https://medium.com/@soulawalid/data-science-crisp-dm-process-for-data-science-b55b1bbfd19a). The three Questions and my BlogPost about this topic see [here]()

## Context
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way.
As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Boston, MA.
For more informations about the dataset see [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston/code).

# Installation
You need a valid Python distribution. Preferably Python 3.8.0 or higher, as this is supported. A Jupyter notebook is ideal for programming. Once you can Install Anaconda from official site [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or on the other hand you can use Editor of your joice i.e. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install jupyter as package and best with extensions for Jupyter in VSC.

## Dependencies
    Python (>= 3.8)
    NumPy (>= 1.17.3)
    Pandas (included, if numpy was installed)
    Sklearn
    matplotlib 
    seaborn
    missingno

# File Descriptions
There are 1 notebook available "Answer 3 Questions on Airbnb Open Dataset.ipynb" to showcase work related to the above questions. Most work you can find is Data Cleaning respectively Data Preparation. The aim is to use linear regression as a model to predict the price of accommodation in Boston. All code is written in Python. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# Results
For results you can read my BlogPost on [Medium]().
